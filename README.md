WHAT: an interactive 4h workshop about Vanilla Javascript: basic but cool stuff, that could serve your interview as well;-)
      preferably, come by 2!


WHO:  your guide in the playground, Joeri Lapin, BeCode 2019-2020, Antwerp


DATE: planned date Wednesday 24/06/2020



Learning by doing Quizes/investigating puzzles: the coworkers are given the opportunity to learn in a fun and exciting
way, letting them do the puzzels themselves and in duo.

Every quiz/puzzle takes a concept or a defintion from Javascript in account.

1. It is a workshop, so they will be doing something like reading, analysing, answering
2.The students will help eachother, instead of a Sololearn, they group up 2 by 2 in a Discord Channel:
Duolearn:-)
3.The 4 hours will be spend looking, reading, listening, thinking, interacting in team, answering: actively

Plot 1:
1.Warm up quiz with basic Javascipt multiple choice questions in Kahoot or alike
2.‘Do & make’ --> ‘tell & show’
Puzzles to be solved, followed by the explanation
Plot 2:
‘show and tell’ --> ‘do & make’
Plot 3:
?

Tips and tricks:
- it will be fun;-)
- I will stress:-), not because of the ‘guys’, but because of the online setup...

B. more difficult questions source Sololearn etc...

C. A brainbraker taken on in a Duolearn approach
