Learning by doing Quizes/investigating puzzles: the coworkers are given the opportunity to learn in a fun and exciting
way, letting them do the puzzels themselves and in duo.

Every quiz/puzzle takes a concept or a defintion from Javascript in account.

2.The students will help eachother, instead of a Sololearn, they group up 2 by 2 in a Discord Channel:
