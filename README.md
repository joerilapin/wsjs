FEEDBACK ABOUT MY WORKSHOP

IRINA(Griosgisteren om 16:36)
Ho, het enige dat ik kan zeggen is mss wat tijd overlaten voor de vragen van kahoot als mensen hun fouten willen overlopen
Voor de rest was het eigenlijk heel tof en ook goed qua niveau
En een heel goede uitleg over de vragen in de ppt zelf

IMANE
k vond het int algemeen goed! ik ging niet mee doen, ma i was invested. ik vond de quizzes leuk
ik miste gwn beetje stuctuur
ma hmm, mss wat beter had geweest is als je echt de quizz antwoorden had overloopt me ons, ma dan had je minder quizzes moeten geven
ik had helemaal ni verwacht om zo veel bij te leren eig dus goed gedaan!
nee dat leren was ook met de quizzes zelf eig
ma aan da structuur kon je ook ni veel aan doen, je had ook what technical difficulties dus dermee, mss had ik het niet gehoord ma in jou workshop was er ook geen duidelijke doel voor het einde, dus wist ook vaak niet waar je naartoe was. ma dit heeft denk ik gwn met mij te maken
want het ging duidelijk over javascript tips and tricks
yes, sws, ma da zijn dingen dat je altijd beter kan doen; but overall i really enjoyed it!
:p

I actually really liked it, it was a very unique workshop and really fun
it was light and heavy at the same time haha
because the questions were so hard but the manner we addressed them was light
I think it might have been nice to maybe have more of a chance to discuss why the answers were that way because some of them were very curious and a lot of us weren't sure why js behaved in such a way
but it is good that you had that with the questions in the powerpoint
it was a cool workshop

Hey, np you're welcome,hmmm maybe do a test run of your workshop then you would see what technical problems could arise like the screensharing thing haha. Kahoot quizzes were really nice I enjoyed them haha

Neil Benin
no problem!   i thought it was a really cool workshop, its always fun to see these funny things that the language does
kahoot quizes was a nice platform to do it as well, keeps it interesting for us
improvement would be to have a small explanation for some of the kahoot quizs answers
but i'm sure you realized that.. some of the ones we all really wanted to discuss why, but we kind of just kept moving

WHAT: an interactive 4h workshop about Vanilla Javascript: basic but cool stuff, that could serve your interview as well;-)
      preferably, come by 2!


WHO:  your guide in the playground, Joeri Lapin, BeCode 2019-2020, Antwerp


DATE: planned date Wednesday 24/06/2020



Learning by doing Quizes/investigating puzzles: the coworkers are given the opportunity to learn in a fun and exciting
way, letting them do the puzzels themselves and in duo.

Every quiz/puzzle takes a concept or a defintion from Javascript in account.

1. It is a workshop, so they will be doing something like reading, analysing, answering
2.The students will help eachother, instead of a Sololearn, they group up 2 by 2 in a Discord Channel:
Duolearn:-)
3.The 4 hours will be spend looking, reading, listening, thinking, interacting in team, answering: actively

Plot 1:
1.Warm up quiz with basic Javascipt multiple choice questions in Kahoot or alike
2.‘Do & make’ --> ‘tell & show’
Puzzles to be solved, followed by the explanation
Plot 2:
‘show and tell’ --> ‘do & make’
Plot 3:
?

Tips and tricks:
- it will be fun;-)
- I will stress:-), not because of the ‘guys’, but because of the online setup...





A. Reactivation of knowledge by basic speedy quiz

B. more difficult questions source Sololearn etc...

C. A brainbraker taken on in a Duolearn approach



SUBJECTS OR THEMES:

1..Making acquaintance with Javascript: algemene termen, definitions, ... to see what they know

2..operators: what?

3..statements, datatypes, variables: what?

4..functions, arrays, objects: what?

5.program flow: what?,  if/for/while/break/continue/return

6.event and event handlers: what?, button, keyboard,...

7.DOM: what?, select elements, add, remove, other DOM functions

8.Advanced use of functions: functions with a variable amount of parameters (the parameter arguments), Iffy,functions call() and apply(), working with closures

9.Modular programming in Javascript: design patterns,object literal, prototype pattern, revealing module pattern(+singleton), inheritance
