a interactive workshop about Javascript 
Workshop Javascript, by Joeri Lapin, BeCode 2019-2020, Antwerp
What: a 4h workshop with Javascript related basic but cool stuff, that could serve your interview;-)
Subject: Javascript (in the broad sense)
Language: Vanilla Javascript

I learn by investigating puzzles, and I give the coworkers the opportunity to learn in a fun and exciting
way, letting them do the puzzels themselves.
Every puzzle takes a concept or a defintion from Javascript in account.
1. It is a workshop, sothey will be doing something like reading, analysing, answering
2.The students will help eachother, instead of a Sololearn, they group up 2 by 2 in a Discord Channel:
Duolearn:-)
3.The 4 hours will be spend looking, reading, listening, thinking, interacting in team, answering: actively
Plot 1:
‘Do & make’ --> ‘tell & show’
Puzzles to be solved, followed by the explanation
Plot 2:
‘show and tell’ --> ‘do & make’

Plot 3:
?

Tips and tricks:
- it will be fun;-)
- I will stress:-), not because of the ‘guys’, but because of the online setup...
